# Dun-Djinn

Source code for a FPS Rogue-lite I wrote in the earlier half of 2018. Unfortunately the project lost traction and we ceased development on it.

Providing this code for others to learn/steal whatever they want from it.

In the LNBPlayerharacter class you'll notice references to "IFPV_Object". This is a third party solution for rendering first person view models very easily and a very good quality. You can find it [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/camera/first-person-view-2-67929).

See [design document](https://github.com/calebsmth54/Dun-Djinn/blob/master/Dun'Djinn_GDD.pdf)
